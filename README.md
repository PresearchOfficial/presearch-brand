# Presearch Logos & Brand Guidelines

Presearch is an open, decentralized search engine that rewards community members
with Presearch Tokens for their usage, contribution to, and promotion of the platform.

We created these guidelines to help authorized users of the Presearch community
represent our brand and identity in a way that is consistent with the quality impact and ambition of our project.

Using these marks accurately is a serious responsibility and is regulated by our brand guidelines. If you have any questions please contact brand@presearch.com.
